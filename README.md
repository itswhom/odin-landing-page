# odin-landing-page

My landing page project as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)'s full stack bootcamp.

Inspired by George Orwell's *[1984](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four)*, what if INGSOC maintained a party website and held the Two Minutes Hate via Zoom?

Grateful for any comments or suggestions, as I continue learning web development. Thanks!
